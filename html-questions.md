#### Q2
### ✍New features of HTML5 
- Improved support for embedding graphics, audio, and video content via the new <code>canvas</code>,`audio`, and`video` tags.
- Extensions to the JavaScript API such as geolocation and drag-and-drop as well for storage and caching.
- Introduction of “web workers”.
- Several new semantic tags (element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer) were also added to complement the structural logic of modern web applications. These include the`main`,`nav`,`article`,`section`,`header`,`footer`,  <code>form</code>,  <code>table</code> and <code>aside</code> tags.
- New form controls, such as`calendar`,`date`,`time`,`email`,`url` and`search`.

#### Q5
### ✍What are semantic elements and explain a few of them? What are their advantages? 
- HTML5’s semantic elements help structure the code we create, making it more readable and easier to maintain.
- They help us structure the code and choose code hierarchy properly.
- It helps in accessibility.
- Several new semantic tags (element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer) were also added to complement the structural logic of modern web applications. These include the`main`,`nav`,`article`,`section`,`header`,`footer`,  <code>form</code>,  <code>table</code> and <code>aside</code> tags

#### Q6
### ✍What is doctype used for? 
- The HTML document type declaration, also known as DOCTYPE , is the first line of code required in every HTML or XHTML document. The DOCTYPE declaration is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in. 
- This ensures that the web page is parsed the same way by different web browsers.
- Doctype syntax for HTML5 and beyond:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
```
- Doctype syntax for strict, transitional and frameset HTML 4.01:
```
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Frameset//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/frameset.dtd">
```

#### Q7
### ✍What is DOM? 
- The Document Object Model (DOM) is the data representation of the objects that comprise the structure and content of a document on the web.
- It is a programming interface for web documents.

#### Q8
### ✍DOM Manipulation
- When writing web pages and apps, one of the most common things you'll want to do is manipulate the document structure in some way. This is usually done by using the Document Object Model (DOM), a set of APIs for controlling HTML and styling information that makes heavy use of the Document object.
- DOM manipulation is one of the most important things when writing JavaScript for web browsers.
- We do DOM manipulation for creating application (webpage), changing the web elements, update the webpage, animate, etc.

#### Q9
### ✍Different types of storage (local storage, session storage, cookies)and which one is the best way to store data?
| Cookies                   | Sessions           | Localstorage  |
| ------------------------  |:------------------------:| ------------------------:|
| The storage capacity of Cookies is 4KB | The storage capacity of session storage is 5MB |  The storage capacity of local storage is 5MB/10MB |
| Cookies expire based on the setting and working per tab and window | It’s session-based and works per window or tab. This means that data is stored only for the duration of a session, i.e., until the browser (or tab) is closed | As it is not session-based, it must be deleted via javascript or manually |
| Both clients and servers can read and write the cookies | The client can only read local storage | The client  can only read local storage |
| Data transfer to the server is exist | There is no transfer of data to the server | There is no transfer of data to the server |
| It is supported by all the browser including older browser | There are fewer old browsers that support it | There are fewer old browsers that support it |

#### Q10
### ✍Drag and drop used in HTML5
```js
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
  <head>
    <style>
    #div1 {
        width: 350px;
        height: 70px;
        padding: 10px;
        border: 1px solid #aaaaaa;
    }
    </style>
    <script>
      function allowDrop(ev) {
          ev.preventDefault();
      }

      function drag(ev) {
          ev.dataTransfer.setData("text", ev.target.id);
      }

      function drop(ev) {
          ev.preventDefault();
          var data = ev.dataTransfer.getData("text");
          ev.target.appendChild(document.getElementById(data));
      }
    </script>
  </head>
  <body>

    <p>Drag the W3Schools image into the rectangle:</p>

    <div id="div1" ondrop="drop(event)" ondragover="allowDrop(event)"></div>
    <br>
    <img id="drag1" src="img_logo.gif" draggable="true" ondragstart="drag(event)" width="336" height="69">

#### Q12
### ✍Datalist tag
A `<datalist>` tag can be used to create a simple auto-complete feature for a web page. 
```js
Please Select Country: <input type="text" list="countries" name="country" />

#### Q14
### ✍SVG and canvas
- The <svg> element is a container for SVG graphics. SVG has several methods for drawing paths, boxes, circles, text, and even bitmap images.
- SVG is a language for describing 2D graphics, but <canvas> allows you to draw 2D graphics on the fly using JavaScript.
- In SVG, each drawn shape is remembered as an object. If attributes of an SVG object are changed, the browser can automatically re-render the shape.
- Canvas is rendered pixel by pixel. In canvas, once the graphic is drawn, it is forgotten by the browser. If its position should be changed, the entire scene needs to be redrawn, including any objects that might have been covered by the graphic.

#### Q15
### ✍What are the different types of script tags? (async,defer)
- Async scripts are executed as soon as the script is loaded, so it doesn't guarantee the order of execution (a script you included at the end may execute before the first script file )
```js
<script async src="https://examples.com/long.js"></script>
```
- Defer scripts guarantees the order of execution in which they appear in the page.
```js
<script defer src="https://examples.com/long.js"></script>
```

#### Q17
### ✍How the browser renders HTML and CSS? Explain in detail.
###### The main components of browser are

![Browser Flow](https://i.ibb.co/jJJwKPr/browser-components.png)

- When a web page is loaded, the browser first reads the HTML text and constructs DOM Tree from it.  - Then it processes the CSS whether that is inline, embedded, or external CSS and constructs the CSSOM Tree from it. 
- After these trees are constructed, then it constructs the Render-Tree from it.

#### Q18
### ✍What are web workers?
A web worker is a script that runs in the background (i.e., in another thread) without the page needing to wait for it to complete. The user can continue to interact with the page while the web worker runs in the background. Workers utilize thread-like message passing to achieve parallelism.
